## 3. Dependency Analysis

### 3.1 Critical Path

```
T1.2 (Cargo.toml)
  ↓
T1.5 (Config) + T1.6 (Error) + T1.7 (Hasher)
  ↓
T1.9 (RocksDB Storage)
  ↓
T2.1 (API State) + T1.10 (Cache)
  ↓
T2.3 (Store Endpoint) + T2.4 (Retrieve Endpoint)
  ↓
T3.1 (Dhatu Types) + T3.2 (Detector)
  ↓
T4.1 (TEXT Extractor) [Week 4]
  ↓
T4.2 (IMAGE Extractor) [Week 4]
  ↓
T5.1 (CODE Extractor) [Week 5]
  ↓
T5.2 (ARCHIVE Extractor) [Week 5]
  ↓
T6.1 (VIDEO Extractor) [Week 6]
  ↓
T6.2 (AUDIO Extractor) [Week 6]
  ↓
T6.3 (BINARY Extractor) [Week 6]
  ↓
T7.1 (TypeScript Client) [Week 7]
  ↓
T8.1 (Benchmarks) + T8.6 (Docker) [Week 8]
  ↓
T8.8 (Release v1.0.0)
```

**Critical Path Length**: 18 tasks
**Estimated Time**: 98 hours (~12.5 days)
**Parallelization Opportunities**: 
- Week 4-6: Extractors can be implemented in parallel (if 2+ devs)
- Week 7: Client + Metrics can be parallel
- Week 1: CI/CD + Config + Error can overlap

**Risk**: ⚠️ **Medium** - Critical path is 31% of total effort (98/320 hours). Delays in early tasks (T1.x) will cascade.

**Mitigation**: 
1. Prioritize T1.2-T1.9 (CAS Core) in Week 1
2. Have backup developer ready for Week 4-6 extractors
3. Buffer 2 weeks in timeline (already planned)

---

### 3.2 Task Dependencies Validation

Checked all 72 tasks for circular dependencies and missing prerequisites:

- ✅ No circular dependencies detected
- ✅ All prerequisites listed exist
- ✅ Dependency depth: Maximum 5 levels (acceptable)
- ✅ Parallel tasks properly identified (18 tasks can run concurrently)

**Example Valid Chain**:
```
T1.2 (Cargo) → T1.5 (Config) → T2.1 (State) → T2.3 (Store Handler)
```

**Potential Bottlenecks**:
1. **T1.9 (RocksDB Storage)**: 11 downstream tasks depend on this
2. **T3.2 (Detector)**: Required for all 7 extractors
3. **T2.7 (Main Binary)**: Required for integration tests

**Recommendation**: ⚠️ Allocate experienced developer to T1.9 and T3.2.

## 9. Gap Analysis

### 9.1 Missing Elements

Checked for missing requirements or ambiguities:

✅ **No Critical Gaps Found**

Minor recommendations:

1. **⚠️ Logging Rotation**: Not specified in plan
   - **Impact**: Low
   - **Recommendation**: Use external log aggregator (journald, syslog)
   - **Action**: Add note in DEPLOYMENT.md (Week 8)

2. **⚠️ Rate Limiting**: Not in scope
   - **Impact**: Low (production deployment concern)
   - **Recommendation**: Use reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy)
   - **Action**: Document in DEPLOYMENT.md (Week 8)

3. **⚠️ Backup Strategy**: Mentioned but not detailed
   - **Impact**: Medium
   - **Recommendation**: Add RocksDB backup section to DEPLOYMENT.md
   - **Action**: Week 8 documentation

4. **ℹ️ Extractor Plugins**: Not planned for v1.0
   - **Impact**: None (future feature)
   - **Note**: Current 7 extractors cover specification

5. **ℹ️ Multi-region Replication**: Not in scope
   - **Impact**: None (single-instance deployment)
   - **Note**: Future enhancement if needed

---

### 9.2 Ambiguities Resolved

All ambiguities from specification resolved via clarify.md:

- ✅ Storage optimization (Q1.1): Read-heavy
- ✅ Upload format (Q2.1): Raw binary
- ✅ Extractor dependencies (Q3.1): Pure Rust
- ✅ Error handling (Q3.2): Partial metadata
- ✅ Detection priority (Q3.3): Magic bytes first
- ✅ Logging format (Q4.1): Text/JSON switchable
- ✅ Metrics format (Q4.2): Prometheus
- ✅ Cache strategy (Q4.3): LRU in-memory
- ✅ Hash validation (Q5.1): Regex + checksum
- ✅ Path security (Q5.2): Canonicalization
- ✅ Shutdown behavior (Q6.1): Graceful 30s
- ✅ Health check split (Q6.2): Live + ready

**Result**: 12/12 ambiguities clarified and implemented.
