# Human language and development

From infancy to adulthood: stages, observations, and implications for PaniniFS.

## Synthesis (draft)
- Early communicative primitives (gestures, proto-words) as scaffolds for Dhātu mapping.
- Progressive abstraction and compositionality; memory constraints shape semantic compression.

## Hypotheses
- Milestones correlate with stable semantic operators (e.g., agent/action/object, negation, temporal markers).

## Validation paths
- Align milestones with an incremental Dhātu set; evaluate coverage on child-directed corpora.
