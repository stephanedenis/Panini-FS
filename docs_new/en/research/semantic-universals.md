# Semantic universals (Dhātu)

Draft synthesis of assumptions, validation paths, and references.

## Synthesis (draft)

- Problem: identify a compact set of semantic primitives (Dhātu) usable across storage/communication/processing.
- Context: CI stabilized; documentation refocused on the WHAT (research), not the HOW (infra).

## Assumptions
- A small, stable set of semantic primitives can encode broad conceptual coverage.
- Human language acquisition stages inform the emergence order of these universals.

## Validation paths
- Minimal test protocol: coverage, ambiguity, reversibility of encoding.

## Sources (FR journals)
- See Copilotage journals dated 2025‑08‑30 for context and decisions.
