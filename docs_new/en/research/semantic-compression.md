# Computational semantic compression

Principles, metrics, and use cases (storage, communication, processing, learning, education).

## Synthesis (draft)
- Target minimal loss of meaning at fixed bitrate via DhƒÅtu representations.
- Evaluate trade-offs: fidelity, decodability, learnability.

## Metrics (to refine)
- Concept coverage, mutual information retained, ambiguity rate, reconstruction accuracy.
